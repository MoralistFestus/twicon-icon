## Using the icon 

The twicon icons Component is an easy and performant way to use twicon in your app. The component will dynamically load an SVG for each icon, so your app is only requesting the icons that you need.

### Including twicon in your projects

To use twicon icons in your projects, you have to set the file path or directory to the `twicon.css` file in the css folder. Or copy this folder to your projects directory and include:

```html
   	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/twicon.css"/> 
```
or

```html
   	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="pathtofile/css/twicon.css"/> 
```
or use the minified version which is twicon.min.css

### Basic usage

To use a built-in icon from the twicon package, follow this guidelines: to use the icon use `twicon-name'
the name specify the name for the icon you want to generate:

```html
<i class="twicon-home"></i>
```

this will generate home icon.


## Variants
Each app icon in twicon has a/an `empty`, `squared` `border` `border-circle` and `circled` variant. These different variants are provided to make your web/app feel native to a variety of platforms. The filled variant uses the default name without a suffix. 

```html
<i class="twicon-camera"></i> 
<i class="twicon-info-circled"></i>
<i class="twicon-facebook-squared"></i>
<i class="twicon-heart-empty"></i>
<i class="twicon-css3 twicon-border"></i>
<i class="twicon-html3 twicon-border-circle"></i>
```

## Size

To specify the icon size, you can use the `twicon-size` attribute for our pre-defined font sizes.

```html
<i class="twicon-home twicon-5x"></i>
<i class="twicon-camera twicon-4x"></i>
<i class="twicon-meetup twicon-3x"></i>
<i class="twicon-facebook-squared twicon-2x"></i>
<i class="twicon-heart-empty twicon-lg"></i>
<i class="twicon-twitter"></i>
```

Or you can set a specific size by applying the `font-size` CSS property on the `.twicon` class component. It's recommended to use pixel sizes that are a multiple of 8 (8, 16, 32, 64, etc.)

```css
.twicon {
  font-size: 64px; /* your icon size */
}
```

## Color

Specify the icon color by applying the `color` CSS property on the `.twicon` class component.

```css
.twicon {
  color: blue;
}
```
Few inbuilt colors are available for use. You need to add the color attribute to the icon like `.dark`.

The following colors are available:
basic, secondary, danger, gold, cool, soft, light, dark, vital

```html
<i class="twicon-github twicon-5x dark"></i>
<i class="twicon-twitter twicon-5x vital"></i>
```


## Stroke weight
When using an `outline` icon variant it is possible to adjust the stroke weight, for improved visual balance relative to the icon's size or relative to the weight of adjacent text. You can set a specific size by applying the `--ionicon-stroke-weight` CSS custom property to the `.twicon` component. The default value is 32px.

```html
<i class="twicon-camera"></i>
```

```css
.twicon {
  --twicon-stroke-width: 16px;
}
```
